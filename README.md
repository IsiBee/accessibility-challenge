# Refactor Horiseon Home Page
​
This first challenge involved updating starter code to abide by accessibility standards, so that the Horiseon home page would be optimized for search engines. This allowed us to use Git, HTML, and CSS to update Horiseon's homepage.
​
## Description
​
The project involved updating the HTML and CSS to abide by accessibility standards. This was accomplished by abiding by the following acceptance criteria:
1. Adding semantic elements to the HTML.
2. Structuring the HTML elements to follow the flow of the page.
3. Adding alt elements and descriptions to img tags.
4. Organizing the heading attributes so they fall in sequential order.
5. Updating the Title with a more descriptive title.

Additionally this project required removing redundancies and properly commenting the CSS file. As well as correcting some links in the HTML file.

### Mock Up
​
Another training point we learned from this challenge is taking a mock up and ensuring our final application looks just like the mock-up the design team gave us. 
* One thing to note is the mock-up does not include the footer, however based on the lesson from this module I have decided to keep the footer since the acceptance criteria does not make any indication as to whether it should be removed.
